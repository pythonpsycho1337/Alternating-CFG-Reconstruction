# ACFR
## Overview
ACFR stands for Alternating Control Flow Reconstruction and is a project whose goal is to reconstruct precise control flow of x86 binaries using under and over-approximation alternatingly. The over-approximation is done with the static analysis tool Jakstab and the under-approximation with the dynamic symbolic execution platform manticore.
## Installation

The tool does currently only support debian-based operating systems and has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

To install the program, simply execute the compile script:
```
./compile.sh
```
